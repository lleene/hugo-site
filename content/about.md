This site shares a bit of informal documentation and blog-based record keeping
reflecting my day to day activities. Hopefully it's a good mix of technical and
just-for-fun discussion. Professionally I am a mixed-signal circuit designer
which means I compose integrated circuits mostly for sensors whose signals are
then processed for interesting features. Besides that I enjoy a bit of casual
programming as a hobby which is now predominantly based on python which makes
it easy to share and adapt code.

# Proficiencies

I have well over 10 years of design experience using Cadence and Seimens (Mentor Graphics)
EDA design suite extensively from process-development-kit integration to mixed-signal
design verification. Having predominantly designed mixed-signal instrumentation chips most of my
proficiency lies with the Virtuoso analogue design flow. However I have historically
worked in smaller design groups of 5-10 people where you need to be familiar with
the entire development process for a device from start to finish touching on process selection,
tool configuration, and production planning. Fortunately  

with ADE/Measto verification
but I am quite comfortable with skill and any Cadence know how for speeding up design development.
