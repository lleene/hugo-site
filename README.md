# Personal Page: Lieuwe Leene

Landinge page for lieuwe.leene.dev using Hugo and a theme derived from the
Hermit template. This will be my personal site sharing various kinds of content
and updates related to work or my hobbies as I host a couple of web-services. 

## Setup

The intention here is that the master branch is statically served while the
development branch is prototyped while being served from memory. Any generated
content in public/static should not be tracked by the repository.
